Perl version of gamed (casual game server &amp; clients)

### Getting Started
Start off by making sure you have a working install of Perl5.  If you're on Windows, using Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/)
is highly recommended.

You'll next want to invoke the install script for your platform.  It takes care of installing various libraries you'll need.

Once you've got the depenencies squared away, invoke the gamed script in the script folder to launch the game server.
